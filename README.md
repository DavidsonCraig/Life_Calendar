# Life_Calendar
https://davidsoncraig.github.io/Life_Calendar/

This is a minimalist life calendar which hopefully visualises how precious our time is. Simply input your date of birth and a life calendar will be generated. Each dot represents 1 week of your life, there are 52 rows representing  52 weeks in a year, and 80 columns representing an 80 year life span. Each week the calendar will update and fill in a dot.
